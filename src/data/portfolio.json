    "bio": "Engineer and **applied researcher** with over six years of interdisciplinary experience in **AI**, **data science**, and **computational modeling**, shaped across **Europe, Asia, and the U.S.**\n\nMy work bridges **AI research and real-world application**, spanning **generative AI** (GANs, VAEs, segmentation, 3D synthesis), **time-series forecasting**, **surrogate modeling**, and **trustworthy AI** for privacy-preserving analytics.\n\nI started working with **AI, data, and computational modeling** driven by the curiosity to understand how technology could become a **tool to improve reality**, not just to automate it. Over the years, this curiosity has evolved into a passion for building intelligent, explainable, and responsible systems that merge creativity and logic.\n\nI've **designed and deployed ML/DL models** for occupancy detection, energy forecasting, and privacy threat assessment, and explored **LLM orchestration** and **multimodal agents** for IoT data analysis — proposing **data obfuscation** and **differential privacy** strategies to strengthen cybersecurity.\n\nProficient in **Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn)** and modern **data pipelines**, I combine theoretical insight with hands-on implementation, delivering models that are **interpretable, efficient, and impactful**.\n\nBeyond data and algorithms, my work is deeply about **people** and **collaboration**. The principles that guide me every day are:\n\n- **Transparent feedback** as a foundation for growth,\n- **Mentoring and shared learning**, and\n- **Collaborative problem-solving** as a driver of innovation.\n\nI'm always open to **collaborations and applied research opportunities** where technology meets impact — bridging the gap between **innovation** and **everyday life**.",
