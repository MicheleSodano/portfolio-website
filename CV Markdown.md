## About Me

Engineer and applied researcher with 6+ years in AI, data science, and computational modeling across Europe, Asia, and North America. I started working with AI, data, and computational modeling driven by the curiosity to understand how technology could become a tool to improve reality, not just to automate it. Over the years, this curiosity has evolved into a passion for building intelligent, explainable, and responsible systems that merge creativity and logic.

I've designed and deployed ML/DL models for smart buildings, energy forecasting, occupancy detection, and privacy-preserving analytics. My work spans generative AI (GANs, VAEs, 3D synthesis), time-series forecasting, surrogate modeling, and trustworthy AI, exploring LLM orchestration, differential privacy, and data obfuscation for secure IoT systems. Proficient in Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn) and modern data pipelines, I bridge research and production, delivering interpretable, efficient, and impactful solutions.

Beyond data and algorithms, my work is deeply about people and collaboration. The principles that guide me every day are transparent feedback as a foundation for growth, mentoring and shared learning, and collaborative problem-solving as a driver of innovation.

I'm always open to collaborations and applied research opportunities where technology meets impact: bridging the gap between innovation and everyday life.
